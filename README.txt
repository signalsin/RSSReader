RSSReader

A simple application to read RSS feeds.

Currently it accepts one URL as a command line argument and prints the titles and links of the latest 15 results.
This will eventually be expanded upon with a user interface, saving multiple feeds etc.
Based upon an application found in Programming with Java by Roger Cadenhead.
